# SpotifyBaconNumber
Description: This project focuses on Spotify artists. We wanted to find the "Kevin Bacon number" equivalent for Spotify artists that worked together 
i.e. were featured on the same song. We used data sets that contained artists with their features, translated the data into an adjacency list, and ran BFS to get the
distance between artists. Then, we ran an experiment to determine what the average distance from Pitbull was.
